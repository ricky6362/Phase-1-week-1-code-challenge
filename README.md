Toy Problem Solutions
This repository contains solutions to three toy problems. Each problem is described below along with instructions on how to run the corresponding program.

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows:

A > 79
B > 60 to 79
C > 49 to 59
D > 40 to 49
E > less than 40

How to Run
Open the folder named challenge-one.
Run the index.html file for the challenge-one.
The website will provide a prompt tab to enter your scores.
The website creates an alert box that returns the value of the grade and the range.
Finally, reload the website to check for different results if the student marks change.

Challenge 2: Speed Detector
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car, e.g., 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program should print: "License suspended".

How to Run
Open the folder named challenge-two.
Run the index.html file for the challenge-two.
The website will provide a prompt tab to enter your speed.
The website creates an alert box that returns the value of the message in relation to the speed.
Finally, reload the website to check for different results if the car's speed changes.


Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
Given the basic salary and benefits of an employee, write a program that calculates the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions, and net salary.

How to Run
