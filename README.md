If the driver gets more than 12 points, the program should print: "License suspended".

How to Run
1.Run the index.html file for the challenge-two.
2.The website will provide a prompt tab to enter your speed.
3.The website creates an alert box that returns the value of the message in relation to the speed.
4.Finally reload the website to check for different results if the car's speed changes.
